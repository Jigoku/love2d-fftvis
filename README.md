FFTVis a simple music player with a bar visualization. Full commented source code.

##How to run this
You'll need to install the following libraries:
- love2d (love2d.org)
- luafft

To do so, install first love2d on your machine. Then, download all luafft files, navigate to love2d installation folder and paste
luafft's "lua" folder on the root of love2d folder.
After doing so, simply save main.lua along with a song of your liking on any folder you want and set the Song variable using a
text editor to point at the music you want to play.
Then, just drag and drop this folder to the love2d executable or desktop shortcut.
